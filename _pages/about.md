I received my undergraduate degree at University of Southampton, UK.

I received the B.Sc degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from University of Southapton, UK in 2024. Currently, I pursuing the Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Johns Hopkins University.

# Research Interests

I am mainly on robotic perception and manipulation, including general-purpose grasp, dynamic grasping, dexterous manipulation, and in-hand manipulation. I am interested in studying a challenging problem of efficiently understanding scenarios, reasoning about the grasping trajectory, and carrying out a reliable physical-environment grasping action for constructing an optimized system to perform robust manipulations for domestic, supermarket, warehouse and industrial setting applications. I am motivated by the above problem and working on offering highly resultful solutions through mathematical modeling, gripper design and control, visual perception as well as self-supervision robotic learning.

I am mainly on the imitation learning and data-driven learning in the robot control. I am intereted in studying a challenging problem of mimicing human movement and carrying out a realible design of humanoid robot. I am motivated by the above problem and studying on various techniques, such as reinforcement learning, deep learning, and many control strategy.
