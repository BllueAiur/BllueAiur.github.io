I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Southampton, UK, in 2024. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

# Research Interests

My primary interests lie in imitation learning and data-driven approaches in robotic control. I am particularly fascinated by the challenging problem of mimicking human movement and designing reliable humanoid robots. This motivation drives me to explore various techniques such as reinforcement learning, deep learning, and advanced control strategies.
